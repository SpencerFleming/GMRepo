# GMRepo
For those of you who may not be familiar with the genre, tabletop RPG games
typically feature a 'Game Master' whos job is to entepret the rules for the
other players, design the world and adventures the players partake in, and
generally narrate and manage the game.

Being a GM can be very involved; often times, GMs have entire folders full
of notes on how the player characters are progressing through their
handcrafted stories, how non-player characters work and act, maps of the
world, and on and on. On top of this, Game Masters usually have to keep 
track of turn orders, and do a lot of math on the spot to calculate damage
for all the enemies the players face, if its that kind of game.

Just like an employee in the office, some Game Masters prefer to use
computers to keep track of all these notes, and to help do all this math.
And just like in the office, when the software is bloated, slow, and not
presicely designed for the job at hand, the process grows slower and
more complicated than it would have been if everyone just stuck to pen and
paper.

Some RPG-savy developers have tried to fix this problems with software they
designed specifically for helping GMs keep their notes together, but I've
found that existing software lacks features I'd deem important, or have
arbitrary restrictions that limit what kind of rule sets you can use with
them, and often require having a bunch of tabs open on a browser in order
to use. To me, this doesn't seem to fix any of the problems that just
using word processing software causes, it just changes out one set of
problems to another that is easier to market to potential RPG-playing
customers.

That is why I made this project.

GMRepo is intended to be a general-purpose tabletop RPG repository.
The goal is to make a feature-light web app that grants the user freedom
to customize their stat sheets for any ruleset they want, and ideally do
so with enough ease that it is *actually* faster than using pen and paper
to achieve the same ends. I have wanted this for a long time and I know
there is a market for such software, so I figured I'd go ahead and take
a shot at it for fun!

## Definition of Done
Taking a few pointers from the agile development gurus of the web, here is a
standard definition of done for all the tasks and stories on this project:

To accept an issue as completed and close said issue, a review shall be
conducted. This review is simple: The following questions are asked, an if all the
questions can be answered as a 'yes', then the issue passes and can be
closed.

* Are all the prerequisites for the problem closed?
* Are the task/story requirements completed and functioning?
* Has the task/story been adequately tested?

The last question is the least discrete. The required testing may vary from task
to task. Since there is currently only one developer, testing can be conducted
on a case by case basis. Generally, this will be an informal case testing that
occurs repeatedly as tasks are worked on, in which a set of input sequences
designed to approximate all possible input sequences is tested against the 
expected results.

Tasks that are defined as bug-fixes will recieve exceptionally rigirous testing
to ensure there is no regression due to the fixes.
