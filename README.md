# GMRepo
A general-purpose tabletop RPG repository. A feature-light web app that grants the
user freedom to customize their stat sheets for any ruleset they want, and ideally
do so with enough ease that it is *actually* faster than using pen and paper.

## Definition of Done
Taking a few pointers from the agile development gurus of the web, here is a
standard definition of done for all the tasks and stories on this project:

To accept an issue as completed and close said issue, a review shall be
conducted. This review is simple: The following questions are asked, an if all the
questions can be answered as a 'yes', then the issue passes and can be
closed.

* Are all the prerequisites for the problem closed?
* Are the task/story requirements completed and functioning?
* Has the task/story been adequately tested?

The last question is the least discrete. The required testing may vary from task
to task. Since there is currently only one developer, testing can be conducted
on a case by case basis. Generally, this will be an informal case testing that
occurs repeatedly as tasks are worked on, in which a set of input sequences
designed to approximate all possible input sequences is tested against the 
expected results.

Tasks that are defined as bug-fixes will recieve exceptionally rigirous testing
to ensure there is no regression due to the fixes.
